                <h2>Video Games!</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm sure it comes as no surprise that an aspiring software developer enjoys video games!
                    As someone who grew up loving fantasy and magic, I tend to gavitate towards role-playing/adventure games set in a fantastical world.
                    Below are some of my favorite games.
                </p>

                <h2>TV Shows!</h2>
                <p>
                    From japanese anime, mindless reality drama, historical fiction, and everything in between, I love the art of television. 
                    I love seeing people share their vision and stories through so many different creative lenses.
                </p>
