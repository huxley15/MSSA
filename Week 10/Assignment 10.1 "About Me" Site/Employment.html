                <p><strong>Project Manager</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked alongside contractors and engineers at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to plan and oversee an 18-month maintenance period for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier</li>
                    <li><em>Constantly</em> nodded my head while navy chiefs rambled on about blatantly incorrect info knowing I'll do the correct thing regardless of what they say</li>
                    <li>Attended daily meeings to continuously update the dynamic planning schedule</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Reactor Controls Maintenance Technician</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Oversaw the operations and maintenance of the two nuclear reactors onboard CVN-71 USS Theodore Roosevelt</li>
                    <li>Stared <em>wistfully</em> at essentially static numbers and graphs on screens praying that something would spontaneously combust to spice up a late night shift</li>
                    <li>Repainted the same walls myriad times to hide mold because they'd rather hide the mold than fix the poor exhaust ventilation causing the mold</li>
                    <li>Coordinated watchbills for the entire department of over 600 people to ensure proper coverage for every scheduled plant evolution</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Food Service Supervisor</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Directly oversaw department of 50 people for production and selling of food product to a hungry mob who somehow found a way to be picky about a $1.50 hotdog</li>
                    <li>Wrote the shift schedule for all employees in my department based on sales figures to maintain minimal payroll margins because in the end, you're only ever a number in the system</li>
                    <li>Enforced the strictest food safety and cleanliness standards in all practices</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Communicated with vendors to schedule deliveries who made the entire process feel like a wild ordeal even though they schedule the same time slot every single week</li>
                    <li>Operated a forklift to unload product and distribute it throughout the warehouse while arttfully dodging the sleepy stockers who can't bother to watch for heavily machinery pummeling down the aisle</li>
                    <li>Oversaw the proper handling and disposal of HAZMAT because <strong>no, Robert,</strong> you can't just pour toxic chemicals down the drain</li>
                    <li>Often found myself spiraling in an existential crisis about my life trajectory</li>
